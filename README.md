# Evaluation_suspended_sand_sampling_systems
Evaluation of three sampling systems for measuring sand suspension in rivers.
This repository contains the codes used to create the figures in the corresponding article.
The required data are suspended-sand measurements in the Isere River at Grenoble Campus, available at
https://doi.org/10.57745/YTCYSX and described by Marggraf (2024), and other comparison experiments available at https://doi.org/10.57745/5EBITB.

The codes are:
- Figures_article.py: used to analyse most of the data and create the corresponding figures.
- Crushing_sand_particles_pump_PP36.py: used to analyse the data on potential crushing of sand particles by the pump PP36
- test_suspCL_ErUp.m: used to estimate the transit error and its impact on the sand concentration determined by the Delft bottle
